## Managing Schedules

Schedules allow the timer to start automatically at preset times every week.

### Accessing the Schedule Page

1. Login as an operator or admin
2. Click the **calendar icon** in the top navigation bar
3. You'll see the weekly schedule calendar

### Understanding the Schedule Calendar

- **Columns**: Days of the week (Sunday through Saturday)
- **Rows**: Hours of the day (6 AM to 11 PM)
- **Colored blocks**: Existing schedules
- **Click any block**: Edit or delete that schedule

### Creating a New Schedule

1. Click the **"Add Schedule"** button (above the calendar)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Club Name**: Your club's name (e.g., "Eagles Badminton Club")
   - **Day of Week**: Select from Sunday through Saturday
   - **Start Hour**: Hour in 24-hour format (18 = 6 PM)
   - **Start Minute**: Minute (0-59)
   - **Duration**: How many minutes the session lasts (e.g., 90 for 1.5 hours)
   - **Enabled**: Check this box to activate the schedule
3. Click **"Save Schedule"**
4. Your schedule appears on the calendar

**Example:**
- Club Name: "Morning Stars"
- Day: Wednesday
- Start Hour: 18 (6 PM)
- Start Minute: 30
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Result: Timer starts every Wednesday at 6:30 PM for 90 minutes

### Editing a Schedule

1. Click the colored schedule block on the calendar
2. Form populates with existing values
3. Make your changes
4. Click **"Save Schedule"**

### Deleting a Schedule

1. Click the colored schedule block on the calendar
2. Click the **"Delete Schedule"** button
3. Confirm deletion
4. Schedule is removed from calendar and NVS storage

### Enabling Automatic Scheduling

For schedules to actually trigger the timer:

1. Make sure the **"Automatic Scheduling" toggle** (at top of schedule page) is **ON** (green)
2. If it's off, schedules are stored but won't trigger the timer
3. Only operators and admins can toggle this setting

### How Auto-Start Works

When automatic scheduling is enabled:

1. ESP32 checks every minute if any schedule should start
2. If current time matches a schedule's start time, timer starts automatically
3. Timer runs for the scheduled duration
4. A 2-minute cooldown prevents re-triggering
5. **Important**: NTP time must be synced (green ‚úì) for schedules to work

### Viewing Schedules (Role-Based)

- **Operators**: See only schedules they created (where owner matches their username)
- **Admins**: See ALL schedules from ALL clubs
- **Viewers**: See all schedules (read-only)

This ensures operators can't accidentally modify another club's booking times.

---

## Understanding NTP Time Sync

### What is NTP?

NTP (Network Time Protocol) automatically synchronizes the ESP32's clock with internet time servers. This ensures accurate timekeeping for schedules.

### NTP Status Indicators

Next to the clock display, you'll see one of three indicators:

**‚úì (Green Check mark)**
- Time is successfully synced
- Schedules will trigger at correct times
- Everything is working normally

**‚è≥ (Amber Hourglass, pulsing)**
- Currently syncing with time server
- Wait 30-60 seconds after ESP32 boots
- Schedules may not work until syncing completes

**‚úó (Red X, pulsing)**
- Time sync failed
- ESP32 may not have internet access
- **Schedules will NOT work correctly**
- Check network connection

### Why NTP Matters

- Schedules depend on accurate time
- Without NTP sync, the ESP32's clock may drift
- Drifting clock causes schedules to trigger at wrong times
- Always check for green ‚úì before relying on automatic scheduling

### Troubleshooting NTP

If you see ‚úó (red X):

1. Check ESP32 has internet access (can it reach external websites?)
2. Verify router allows UDP port 123 (NTP port)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes after power-on
4. Check serial monitor for NTP error messages
5. Try restarting ESP32

2. Check password is correct (case-sensitive)
3. For operators: Verify account was created by admin
4. For admin: Verify you're using correct admin password
5. If admin password is forgotten, see "Hardware Factory Reset" below
6. Check serial monitor for authentication logs

---

### Hardware Factory Reset (Emergency Recovery)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will delete ALL data including:**
- All user accounts (admin and operators)
- All schedules
- All settings
- Hello Club integration settings

**When to use:**
- Admin password is forgotten and cannot be recovered
- System is unresponsive or corrupted
- Need to completely start over

**How to perform hardware factory reset:**

1. **Locate the BOOT button** on your ESP32 board
   - Usually labeled "BOOT", "IO0", or "FLASH"
   - Typically located near the USB port
   - Often colored blue or black

2. **Press and HOLD the BOOT button for 10 seconds**
   - Don't release the button early
   - You'll hear/see feedback every 2 seconds:
     - Serial monitor shows countdown: "Factory reset: 2 seconds...", "Factory reset: 4 seconds...", etc.
     - Relay clicks briefly (if siren connected, you'll hear short beeps)

3. **After 10 seconds**, factory reset will trigger:
   - Serial monitor shows: "FACTORY RESET TRIGGERED!"
   - Relay/siren will beep 5 times rapidly (1 second total)
   - Device displays: "Factory reset complete. Restarting in 3 seconds..."
   - ESP32 automatically restarts

4. **After restart:**
   - All settings are back to factory defaults
   - Admin password is reset to: `admin` / `admin`
   - Timer defaults: 21 minutes, 60 second break, 3 rounds
   - All schedules deleted
   - All operator accounts removed

5. **Immediately change the admin password** after factory reset

**Tips:**
- Hold the button steady for the full 10 seconds
- If you release before 10 seconds, the reset is cancelled (no data loss)
- Watch the serial monitor if possible to see progress
- Make sure the device has power during the entire process

**Can't find the BOOT button?**
- Check your ESP32 board documentation
- Common ESP32 boards (NodeMCU, DevKit, WROOM) all have a BOOT button
- It's usually next to the "EN" (Enable/Reset) button
- GPIO 0 is the BOOT button pin

### Problem: Schedule Not Triggering

**Symptoms:** Timer doesn't start at scheduled time

**Check these:**
1. **NTP Status**: Must show green ‚úì (not ‚è≥ or ‚úó)
2. **Scheduling Toggle**: Must be ON (green)
3. **Schedule Enabled**: Individual schedule must have "Enabled" checked
4. **Correct Time**: Schedule time matches Pacific/Auckland timezone
5. **Cooldown**: Wait 2 minutes after last trigger
6. **Day of Week**: Verify day is correct (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)

**Steps:**
1. Check NTP indicator - if red ‚úó, see "Understanding NTP Time Sync"
2. Check "Automatic Scheduling" toggle at top of schedule page
3. Click your schedule block and verify "Enabled" is checked
4. Verify start time is correct (24-hour format)
5. Check serial monitor for schedule trigger logs

---

### Problem: Session Keeps Timing Out

**Symptoms:** After 30 minutes, controls become disabled, "Session expired" message

**Explanation:** This is a security feature. After 30 minutes of inactivity, you're automatically downgraded to viewer mode.

**Solutions:**
1. Send any WebSocket message to reset timer (e.g., refresh page, click anything)
2. Login again when timeout occurs
3. If timeout is too aggressive for your use case, ask developer to adjust `SESSION_TIMEOUT` in main.cpp

---

### Problem: Can't See Other Club's Schedules

**Symptoms:** Calendar only shows your own schedules

**Explanation:** This is by design. Operators only see their own club's schedules.

**Solutions:**
- If you need to see all schedules, login as admin
- If you're admin but only seeing your schedules, check you're logged in as admin (not operator)
- Check username displayed in top right corner

---

### Problem: Calendar Doesn't Update After Adding Schedule

**Symptoms:** Schedule saved but doesn't appear on calendar

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Check for error message (red notification)
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
4. Verify WebSocket is connected (green dot in status indicator)
5. Try logging out and back in

---

### Problem: "Rate Limit" Error

**Symptoms:** "ERR_RATE_LIMIT: Too many requests. Please slow down."

**Explanation:** You're sending more than 10 WebSocket messages per second. This is a security protection against abuse.

**Solutions:**
1. Stop clicking buttons rapidly
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Try again more slowly
4. If problem persists, reload page

---

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Operators

1. **Use Descriptive Club Names**
   - Good: "Eagles Badminton Club", "Morning Stars"
   - Bad: "Club 1", "Us", "Test"

2. **Check NTP Before Creating Schedules**
   - Always verify green ‚úì before setting up automatic scheduling
   - If time is wrong, schedules will trigger at wrong times

3. **Test Your Schedules**
   - Create a test schedule for a few minutes in the future
   - Verify it triggers correctly
   - Delete test schedule after confirming

4. **Coordinate with Other Clubs**
   - While you can't see their schedules, communicate to avoid conflicts
   - Ask admin to check for conflicts if needed

5. **Change Your Password**
   - Change default password after first login
   - Use password at least 8 characters long
   - Don't share password with unauthorized people

6. **Document Your Schedules**
   - Keep a backup record of your club's schedule times
   - Useful if factory reset is needed

### For Admins

1. **Change Admin Password Immediately**
   - Default "admin"/"admin" is insecure
   - Use strong password (12+ characters)
   - Don't share admin password

2. **Create Descriptive Operator Usernames**
   - Use pattern like "club_clubname" or "coordinator_lastname"
   - Makes it easy to identify which club each operator manages

3. **Monitor Schedule Conflicts**
   - Regularly check calendar for overlapping bookings
   - Proactively contact clubs if conflicts arise

4. **Regular Password Rotations**
   - Ask operators to change passwords every 3-6 months
   - Change admin password regularly

5. **Document Operator Accounts**
   - Keep a list of which operator username belongs to which club
   - Include contact information for each operator
   - Useful when operator leaves and needs replacement

6. **Before Factory Reset**
   - Screenshot the calendar to preserve schedule information
   - Export or write down all operator usernames
   - Notify all operators that reset will occur
   - Only use as last resort

7. **Test NTP Status**
   - Verify time sync works after ESP32 reboots
   - Check timezone is correct (should show NZ time)
