## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-30

### üéâ Major Release: Multi-Club Scheduling & Authentication

This is a major release adding comprehensive authentication, automated scheduling, and user management systems.

### Added

#### Authentication System
- **Three-tier role-based access control** (VIEWER, OPERATOR, ADMIN)
- **Default admin credentials** (`admin` / `admin`) - change immediately after first use
- **Viewer mode** - anyone can view without authentication
- **Operator accounts** - club coordinators can manage their own schedules
- **Admin account** - full system access including user management
- **Login modal** with username/password inputs and "Continue as Viewer" option
- **Session management** - 30-minute inactivity timeout with automatic viewer downgrade
- **Rate limiting** - 10 messages/second per client to prevent abuse
- **Password change functionality** for all roles (minimum 4 characters for operators)
- **Factory reset** - admin can reset all users, schedules, and settings to defaults
- **Per-client authentication tracking** with username storage

#### Scheduling System
- **Automated weekly recurring schedules** - timer starts automatically at preset times
- **Weekly calendar view** - visual grid (6 AM - 11 PM, Sunday - Saturday)
- **Club-based organization** - each schedule belongs to an operator's club
- **Schedule CRUD operations** - create, read, update, delete with full validation
- **Owner-based permissions** - operators can only edit their own club's schedules
- **Global scheduling toggle** - enable/disable automatic scheduling system-wide
- **Week-minute calculation** - 0-10079 minutes from Sunday 00:00 for trigger detection
- **Auto-trigger detection** - checks every minute if schedule should start timer
- **2-minute cooldown** - prevents duplicate triggers
- **Schedule persistence** - up to 50 schedules stored in NVS
- **Unique ID generation** - timestamp + counter with collision detection
- **Field validation** - day (0-6), hour (0-23), minute (0-59), duration (>0)
- **Schedule page** with add/edit/delete forms and calendar grid

#### User Management
- **Add/remove operators** (admin only)
- **View operator list** (admin only)
- **Password validation** (minimum 4 characters)
- **Maximum 10 operators** (configurable)
- **User management page** with operator list and add/remove controls
- **NVS persistence** for operator credentials

#### Time Synchronization
- **NTP sync status indicator** - ‚úì (synced), ‚è≥ (syncing), ‚úó (error)
- **Visual feedback** - green/amber/red with pulsing animation
- **Robust validation** - year (2020-2100), month (1-12), day (1-31)
- **Status broadcasting** - updates every 5 seconds, only on status change
- **Tooltip details** - timezone, date/time, auto-sync interval
- **Pacific/Auckland timezone** configuration for New Zealand DST

#### Developer Tools
- **Local test server** - Node.js + Express + WebSocket mock server
- **Mock authentication** - test all three roles without ESP32 hardware

- **USER_GUIDE.md** - complete end-user documentation for operators and admins
- **Updated README.md** - v3.0 features, quick start, troubleshooting
- **Updated ARCHITECTURE.md** - authentication, schedules, session management
- **Updated API.md** - all new WebSocket messages with examples
- **CHANGELOG.md** - this file

### Changed

#### WebSocket Protocol
- **Explicit viewer_mode event** - separate from auth_success for empty credentials
- **Nested schedule data** - `{ action: "add_schedule", schedule: {...} }` format
- **Error codes with ERR_ prefix** - standardized error messages
- **Server-side username tracking** - `authenticatedUsernames` map for ownership
- **Increased buffer size** - 2KB ‚Üí 8KB for schedules (handles 50 schedules)
- **Permission checking** - all control actions verify role before execution
- **Owner enforcement** - server sets `ownerUsername`, never accepts from client

#### UI/UX
- **Login modal on page load** - immediate authentication prompt
- **Role-based visibility** - CSS classes hide/disable controls based on role
- **Username display** - shows logged-in user in top right corner
- **Icon navigation** - person icon (users), calendar icon (schedules)
- **Schedule calendar** - CSS Grid layout with colored schedule blocks
- **NTP status** - always visible next to clock display
- **Session timeout notification** - banner warning with re-login option
- **Error notifications** - improved error messages with clear actions

#### Security
- **Server-side validation** - all schedule fields validated before save
- **Permission-based filtering** - operators see only their schedules
- **Rate limiting** - protects against rapid-fire requests
- **Session timeout** - auto-logout after inactivity
- **Ownership security** - client cannot spoof schedule ownership
- **Input sanitization** - username/password length checks

#### Performance
- **Memory cleanup** - `lastTriggerTimes` cleaned up on schedule delete
- **Larger JSON buffer** - prevents overflow with many schedules
- **Improved ID generation** - collision detection with retry mechanism
- **Week wraparound handling** - proper modulo arithmetic for Sunday‚ÜíMonday transition

### Fixed

#### Critical Bugs (Severity: CRITICAL)
1. **WebSocket message format mismatch** - C++ now reads from `doc["schedule"]` instead of root
2. **Username tracking missing** - added `authenticatedUsernames` map for owner attribution
3. **NTP function calls undefined** - removed non-existent `lastSync()`/`nextSync()` calls
4. **Privilege escalation vulnerability** - server never accepts `ownerUsername` from client

#### High-Priority Bugs (Severity: HIGH)
5. **Memory leak on schedule delete** - clean up `lastTriggerTimes` map entry
6. **Buffer overflow with many schedules** - increased from 2KB to 8KB
7. **Schedule ID collisions** - improved generation with counter + collision detection
8. **Week rollover bug** - fixed Saturday‚ÜíSunday schedule triggering with proper modulo

#### Medium-Priority Bugs (Severity: MEDIUM)
9. **No rate limiting** - added 10 messages/second per client limit
10. **Authentication bypass** - explicit `viewer_mode` event prevents confusion
11. **No minimum password length** - enforced 4-character minimum for operators
12. **Usernames logged in serial** - redacted usernames from logs (only in DEBUG mode)

#### Low-Priority Bugs (Severity: LOW)
13. **No session timeout** - added 30-minute inactivity timeout
14. **Generic error messages** - standardized with ERR_ prefixes and descriptive text
15. **Weak NTP sync detection** - improved validation with year/month/day checks

### Security

- **16 security and stability fixes** across critical, high, medium, and low severity
- **Owner-based permission system** prevents unauthorized schedule modifications
- **Server-side ownership enforcement** eliminates privilege escalation risk
- **Rate limiting** protects against abuse and denial-of-service
- **Session management** reduces window for session hijacking

## Upgrade Notes

### From v2.0 to v3.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- Authentication is now required for all control actions (timer start/stop, settings)
- WebSocket message format changed for schedule operations (nested `schedule` object)
- Viewers can no longer control timer (login as operator/admin required)

**Migration Steps:**
1. Backup any important configuration
2. Upload new firmware (v3.0)
3. Upload new filesystem (updated web files)
4. First boot: Login as admin (admin/admin)
5. IMMEDIATELY change admin password
6. Create operator accounts for each club coordinator
7. Operators can then create their club's schedules

**Data Loss:**
- Timer settings are preserved (game duration, break duration, etc.)
- No existing schedules or users (fresh start in v3.0)
- WiFi credentials are preserved

**New Features Available:**
- Login as admin to access user management
- Create operator accounts for each club
- Operators can create automated schedules for their clubs
- View weekly calendar of all bookings
- Enable automatic scheduling to start timer on schedule

### From v1.0 to v2.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- WebSocket message format standardized
- Settings now use milliseconds instead of mixed units
- Sync messages sent every 5 seconds (was on-demand)

**Migration Steps:**
1. Upload new firmware (v2.0)
2. Upload new filesystem
3. Existing settings may need reconfiguration
4. Test timer functionality before relying on it

**Benefits:**
- Smoother countdown display (60fps)
- More reliable timing
- Better error handling
- Improved WiFi reliability

## Known Issues

### v3.0.0

**Minor (LOW severity, optional fixes):**
1. Missing JavaScript handlers for `viewer_mode` and `session_timeout` events (cosmetic)
2. No validation for empty `clubName` (edge case)
3. Rate limit off-by-one allows 11 messages instead of 10 (negligible)

**Workarounds:**
1. Page refresh after viewer mode or session timeout works correctly
2. Don't create schedules with empty club names
3. Rate limit still protects against abuse with 11 message allowance

See CODE_REVIEW_ROUND_2.md for full details.
