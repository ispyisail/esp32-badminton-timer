## Quick Start

### For Testing (No Hardware Required)

Want to try the interface before deploying to ESP32?

```bash
cd test-server
npm install
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and login with:
- Admin: `admin` / `admin`
- Operator: `operator1` / `pass123`
- Viewer: Leave fields empty

See `test-server/README.md` for full details.

### For Production Deployment

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect ESP32, relay module, and siren (see INSTALL_GUIDE.md)
2. **Configure Security:** Rename `src/wifi_credentials.h.example` to `src/wifi_credentials.h` and set passwords
3. **Build & Upload:**
   ```bash
   platformio run --target upload      # Upload firmware
   platformio run --target uploadfs    # Upload web interface
   ```
4. **Configure WiFi:** Connect to `BadmintonTimerSetup` network and enter your WiFi credentials
5. **Access Timer:** Navigate to **http://badminton-timer.local**

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- 5V Single-Channel Relay Module
- External Siren or Buzzer (12V recommended)
- 5V USB Power Supply (for ESP32)
- Separate Power Supply for Siren (match siren voltage)
- Jumper Wires

See **INSTALL_GUIDE.md** for complete wiring diagram and assembly instructions.

## Security Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Change default credentials before deployment!**

### Configure Passwords

1. Navigate to `src/` directory and rename `wifi_credentials.h.example` to `wifi_credentials.h`

2. Edit `src/wifi_credentials.h` and update:
   - `OTA_PASSWORD` - Password for firmware updates
   - `WEB_PASSWORD` - Password for web interface (backward compatibility - now uses user system)

3. **Change admin password after first login:**
   - Login as `admin` / `admin`
   - Click user icon ‚Üí Change Password
   - Set a strong password immediately

4. **Create operator accounts:**
   - Login as admin
   - Click user icon ‚Üí Manage Users
   - Add operators for each club with unique passwords (minimum 8 characters)

Example:
```cpp
const char* OTA_PASSWORD = "MySecureOTA2024!";
const char* WEB_PASSWORD = "legacy"; // Not used in v3.0
```

**Security Note:** The `wifi_credentials.h` file is ignored by git to protect your passwords. Never commit this file to a public repository.

## Timezone Configuration

**New in v3.1:** The system now supports configurable timezones for international deployment.

### Setting Your Timezone

1. **Login as admin** (only administrators can change timezone)
2. **Navigate to Settings** (user icon in top navigation)
3. **Locate System Settings section** (admin-only area)
4. **Select your timezone** from the dropdown menu (20 common timezones available)
5. **Changes apply immediately** - all schedules and time displays update instantly

### Available Timezones

The system includes 20 commonly-used timezones:
- **Oceania:** Pacific/Auckland (NZ), Australia/Sydney, Pacific/Fiji
- **Asia:** Asia/Tokyo, Asia/Singapore, Asia/Hong_Kong, Asia/Kolkata, Asia/Dubai
- **Europe:** Europe/London (UK), Europe/Paris, Europe/Berlin, Europe/Moscow
- **Americas:** America/New_York (EST/EDT), America/Chicago (CST/CDT), America/Denver (MST/MDT), America/Los_Angeles (PST/PDT), America/Toronto, America/Mexico_City, America/Sao_Paulo
- **UTC:** UTC (Universal Coordinated Time)

### How It Works

- **Persistent Storage:** Timezone setting is saved to non-volatile memory (survives reboots)
- **Automatic DST:** Timezones with daylight saving time automatically adjust
- **Schedule Conversion:** Hello Club events are converted from UTC to your local timezone
- **Default Timezone:** Pacific/Auckland (New Zealand) - change on first setup if deploying elsewhere

**Important:** Ensure timezone is set correctly before creating schedules. Changing timezone after schedules are created does not retroactively update existing schedule times.

## User Roles Explained

### Viewer (No Login Required)
- View timer countdown
- View current schedules
- **Cannot:** Control timer, create schedules, change settings

### Operator (Club Coordinator)
- Everything viewers can do, plus:
- Start/stop timer manually
- Create/edit/delete their own club's schedules
- View only their own club's schedules
- Change their own password
- **Cannot:** See other clubs' schedules, manage users, factory reset

### Admin (System Administrator)
- Everything operators can do, plus:
- View all schedules from all clubs
- Add/remove operator accounts
- Change admin password
- Perform factory reset
- Manage system settings

## WiFi Configuration

### Method 1: Captive Portal (Recommended)

1. Power on the ESP32
2. Connect to WiFi network: `BadmintonTimerSetup`
3. Browser should auto-open setup page (or go to `http://192.168.4.1`)
4. Select your network, enter password, click Save
5. ESP32 restarts and connects to your network

### Method 2: Hardcode Credentials

1. Rename `src/wifi_credentials.h.example` to `src/wifi_credentials.h`
2. Edit file and set your SSID and password:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "YourNetworkName"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "YourNetworkPassword"
   ```
3. Upload firmware - ESP32 will auto-connect, bypassing captive portal

## Using the Scheduling System

### For Operators

1. **Login:** Enter your operator username and password
2. **Access Schedules:** Click the calendar icon in the top navigation
3. **Enable Scheduling:** Toggle the "Automatic Scheduling" switch to ON
4. **Create Schedule:**
   - Click "Add Schedule" button
   - Enter your club name
   - Select day of week (Sunday-Saturday)
   - Set start time (hour and minute)
   - Set duration in minutes
   - Click Save
5. **View on Calendar:** Your schedule appears in the weekly grid
6. **Edit/Delete:** Click any schedule block to edit or delete it

### For Admins

Admins can see and manage schedules from all clubs. Use this to:
- Resolve scheduling conflicts between clubs
- View overall court utilization
- Remove schedules if needed

### How Auto-Start Works

When scheduling is enabled:
- ESP32 checks every minute if any schedule should trigger
- If current time matches a schedule's start time, timer automatically starts
- Timer runs for the scheduled duration
- Prevents re-triggering within 2 minutes (safety window)

**Important:** Ensure NTP time is synced (check the ‚úì indicator next to the clock) for schedules to work correctly.

## Accessing the Timer

Once connected to your local network:

**Recommended:** http://badminton-timer.local

**Alternative:** Use ESP32's IP address (find in router's DHCP client list)

### Troubleshooting mDNS

If `badminton-timer.local` doesn't work:
- **Use IP Address:** Find ESP32's IP in your router and use that
- **Configure Static IP:** Set a fixed IP for the ESP32 in your router
- **Enable mDNS:** Check router settings for mDNS/Bonjour support
- **Try Different Browser:** Some browsers have better mDNS support

## Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates

Update firmware wirelessly after initial USB upload:

- **OTA Hostname:** `badminton-timer.local`
- **OTA Password:** Set in `src/wifi_credentials.h`

In PlatformIO:
```bash
platformio run --target upload --upload-port badminton-timer.local
```

**Security Note:** Use a strong, unique OTA password. Default is insecure and MUST be changed.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Time not synced" warning
- Check ESP32 has internet access
- NTP requires UDP port 123 outbound
- Wait 30 seconds after boot for first sync
- Check serial monitor for NTP errors

### Schedules not auto-starting
- Ensure "Automatic Scheduling" toggle is ON
- Verify NTP sync indicator shows ‚úì (green checkmark)
- Check schedule time matches current time in your configured timezone
- Verify timezone is set correctly (Settings ‚Üí System Settings)
- Wait 2 minutes after last trigger (safety cooldown)

### Can't login as operator
- Verify operator account was created by admin
- Check username and password (case-sensitive)
- Try factory reset if forgotten (admin only)
- Check serial monitor for auth errors

### Other operators' schedules visible
- This is normal for admins (they see all schedules)
- Operators should only see their own club's schedules
- Check you're logged in with correct username

### Session timeout too frequent
- Default is 30 minutes of inactivity
- Any message to server resets timeout counter
- Adjust `SESSION_TIMEOUT` in `main.cpp` if needed
